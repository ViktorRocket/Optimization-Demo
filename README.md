# Optimization-Demo
My attemt to make optimization understandable

Many courses about data science claim that they can teach it without calculus. Then they spend the next hour talking about calculus concepts. I hope, I found a better way to show these concepts. For simplicity, everything was done in Python.

Here I made a script that tries to approximate the image by semi-randomly placing black and white lines. It can be useful to show how "small steps" converge into the original image.
